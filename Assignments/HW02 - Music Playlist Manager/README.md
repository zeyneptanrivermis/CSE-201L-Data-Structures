# Music Playlist Management System
# Description
This project implements a Music Playlist Management System using a Doubly Circular Linked List (CDLL) data structure. The system allows users to manage a music playlist with operations such as adding, removing, and navigating between songs. The playlist is structured using a custom CDLL implementation, ensuring that the playlist can traverse in both directions and wraps around seamlessly at the ends.

# Features
Add songs to the beginning or end of the playlist.
Remove songs from the beginning, end, or the current position.
Play the first, last, previous, or next song.
Display the current list of songs in the playlist.
Navigate through the playlist seamlessly with a doubly circular linked list structure.

# Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Note: The graphical user interface (GUI) implementation seen in this project is not part of the core assignment. The GUI was provided externally and was not written by me.
